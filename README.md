👀 I’m interested in web development and creating efficient and user-friendly applications. 
I have experience in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, and MongoDB, 
and I am always looking to expand my skillset and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies.

🌱 I’m currently learning about building full-stack applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) 
and exploring the use of serverless technologies in web development. I am also interested in diving deeper into database design and optimization.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve creating or improving web applications, 
particularly those that have a social impact or address a particular problem in a creative way.

📫 How to reach me: You can find me on GitHub at MiriFurman1 or send me an email at mirifurman@gmail.com.
